### Some general rules when creating a github issue.
- If the issue is a crash always include the crash report and never paste it directly into github. Use a service like pastebin or gist.
- Give as much detail as possible not just "It does not work plz fix!"
- Provide screenshots of your setup if possible especially when dealing with multiblock structures.
